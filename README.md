Jitsi Recording Container. A Standalone recording container for Jitsi Videobridge conferences that would allow us to run a video recorder as a separat MUC participant.


*WARN*
The "libjitsi.jar" in lib/ has been added a patch called "dtls10-cipher-suites-only.diff" for solving DTLS problem. So if you want to use latest version of "libjitsi.jar", you probably need to path with that too:D  
"dtls10-cipher-suites-only.diff" is provided under Jirecon home directory.
